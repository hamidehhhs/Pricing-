# Pricing as a tool for revenue managment 
Def of revenue : <br/>
As Wiki said : in accounting, revenue is the income that a business has from its normal business activities, usually from the sale of goods and services to customers.<br/>
Def of revenue managment :<br/>
Revenue management is the application of disciplined analytics that predict consumer behaviour at the micro-market level and optimize product availability and price to maximize revenue growth. The primary aim of revenue management is selling the right product to the right customer at the right time for the right price and with the right pack.

### Type1 
have some knowledge about what should be the price of different class seet in diffrent time and need to find the optimal categorization <br/>
Name of paper :<br/>
In this paper they study China High speed railway system and They try to fin. Our strategy is a deterministic booking-limit seat inventory control method They fulfill it in the following steps: <br/>
(The ticket sales method used by the China Railway Customer Service Center (CRCSC) is a deterministic booking-limit control strategy, namely, ticket allocation, which determines the number of seats allocated to each origin-destination (O-D) itinerary for each train during the entire time horizen) <br/>
* In this system they ignor paaenger demand changes and just set a single price for each seat during entire sale horizen , This is a drowback and better way is According to the passenger demand changes, designing different fare classes for homogenous seats 
* They also consider multiple train for each O-D itinerary .considering the seat allocation of multiple trains as a whole could be more beneficial with regard to the reasonable allocation of resources.
For Example in Fig 2 we can see the differnet of this two system , 

*  We will design different fare classes for homogeneous seats based on different customer types, which can increase ticket revenue by better meeting various needs of different types of customers. The customer choice behaviour of each customer type is described by a choice model based on the notion of customer preference order. In addition, multiple trains with different train stop plans are regarded as a whole for optimization. Furthermore, the actual passenger demand is characterized by randomness, and a control strategy without considering the randomness of passenger demand is difficult to obtain better control results. Therefore, our control strategy is provided based on stochastic passenger demand and the passenger demand function can follow any random distribution. And we use random passenger demand density function to generate simulated demands to assess the effectiveness of our control strategy. Finally, to demonstrate the superiority of our strategy, the current control method of the CRCSC is regarded as a comparison scheme in a real-life case. <br/>

### Type 2
In their optimization model to revenue the descion variable is price. which is dynamic with respect to something
