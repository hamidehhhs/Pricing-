# Pricing strategy to optimize other factor in HSR 
In different refrences they try to find suitable price to certatin optimization problem like :

### [Pricing strategy to minimize recovery time](https://github.com/hamidehhhs/Pricing-/blob/master/paper/pricing%20strategy%20to%20minimize%20recovery%20time%20.pdf) 
In their paper recovery time means the time needed for the HSR company to repay its investment costs.
* Breif reveiw: 
 They first try to invent a formula indicaating recovery time with respect to some proper cost and income factors (it is the equation (7) of the paper). Then write an optimization model that set the proper HSR service frequency and ticket price to minimize the recovery time (page 5). 
 The main drowback of their paper is that they don't consider dynamic pricing.
