First we will review some basic concepts about  pricing in train or airline indutry. Then try to defind problems lead to 
pricing optimization <br/> 
### Airline pricing optimization 
" airlines should understand that a pricing strategy doesn’t necessarily mean a race to discounts, promotions or offering the lowest fare. Today, a pricing strategy means being methodical about who an airline wants to be. It should clearly understand the customers it wants to serve and compete well to win and retain those customers. Airlines cannot get caught up in trying to be everything to everyone while competing head-to-head with every airline and still expect to achieve success." <br/>
 pricing strategy can be a tools for total revenue optimization <br/>
 Assume an airline want to serve a new destination or grow an existing market. One naive way is  constantly monitor existing fares (of cpmetitors ) and determine how they are performing? A key element  that is ignored in this way is customer segmentation and willingness to pay. <br/>
 Big data analysis can provide a way for predictive analytics of user behaviors. That’s where change and new pricing practices are essential for competitive airlines. <br/>
 By considering all these an airline can set up strategic decision. But, there is another element of strategic pricing that must be considered — how does an airline learn from what it has implemented? Airlines need to be able to test the market beyond where they have been historically operating to ensure their strategies are working and they learn from the competition.
 These monitoring market performance and competitor actions are element of tactical decision <br/>
