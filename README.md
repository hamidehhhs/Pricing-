Finding an efficient pricing strategy is very importatn challange for many bussineses. Today in big data age using manual pricing decision  won't  satisfy client nor company. However pricing strategy doesnâ€™t necessarily mean a race to discounts, promotions or offering the lowest fare. 
For example assume an airline want to serve a new destination or grow an existing market. One naive way is  constantly monitor existing fares (of competitors ) and decide based on how they are performing, but customer segmentation and willingness to pay is ignored in this way. Which could have great effect on profit. So in price optimization process one need to take care of various item.
